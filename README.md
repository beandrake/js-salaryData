A small project from a Javascript course I'm taking.  The description is:

This web app should allow users to choose specific roles and companies in the tech industry to see the following information:

 -   The salary for the chosen role at the chosen company.
 -   The industry average for the chosen role.
 -   The average salary at the chosen company across all roles.
 -   The industry average salary across all roles and all companies.

Much of the user interface has already been designed by front-end developers, however, the core data and functionality are either missing or need to be connected together using modules.
